        "**The Chungus Incident**\nI lay on the bed, eagerly waiting. The door swings open revealing the marvelous sillhoette of Big Chungus. I grin as his throbbing 12 inch rabbit cock begins to twitch. Chungus darts across the room toward the bed, he throws me to my knees and drives a carrot up into my rectal cavity. A satisfied moan escapes my mouth, which is now being probed by Chungus' stinky thick rod. Before I know it, Chungus has slid himself into my oesophagus, my neck widens, I can't breathe. I fight the urge to vomit as I feel the bitter warm fluid from Chungus' cock cascade into my stomach. As I begin to lose conciousness, I take one last look at Chungus' kind face, he smiles, I am satisfied.",

Upon landing the two quickly unholstered assault rifles and entered the local pizzeria where a massacre of unarmed civilians unfolded as they kept shouting, 'Get Down! Get Down!'. Improvised explosives were then detonated at the site of the crime to obscure the victim's identities.",
